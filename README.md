## Fonts

I use [iA Writer](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.2.1/iA-Writer.zip), a heavy modification of [IBM Plex Mono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.2.1/IBMPlexMono.zip) font.

I also like [Maple Font Nerd Font](https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font), a open source monospace font with round corner, ligatures and Nerd-Font for IDE and command line.
